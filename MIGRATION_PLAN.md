# Project Migration Plan: DeXdo-Plan_Your_Life

**Objective:** To migrate the project from its current inconsistent state to a stable, modern, and maintainable architecture using the latest versions of Angular and Ionic.

---

## Phase 1: Project Archaeology

**Goal:** To identify the original, stable version of the project before the previous AI made its changes.

**Steps:**

1.  **Analyze `package.json`:** I will examine the `package.json` file for clues about the original dependency versions.
2.  **Analyze `angular.json` and `ionic.config.json`:** I will look for version-specific configurations and settings in these files.
3.  **Inspect the Codebase:** I will scan the code for deprecated APIs, old import paths (e.g., `rxjs/operators`), and other version-specific patterns.
4.  **Summarize Findings:** I will present you with a summary of my findings, including the identified original versions of Angular, Ionic, and other key dependencies.

**Deliverable:** A clear picture of the project's original architecture.

## Phase 2: Stabilization

**Goal:** To get the application running in a stable state on a compatible older version of Angular and Ionic.

**Steps:**

1.  **Create a New Branch:** I will ask you to create a new branch in git to ensure that this migration work is isolated from your main branch.
2.  **Revert Dependencies:** I will guide you to revert the `package.json` file to the identified older, compatible versions of the project's dependencies.
3.  **Clean Installation:** I will ask you to delete the `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` file, and then run `npm install` to ensure a clean slate.
4.  **Fix Compilation Errors:** I will analyze and fix any compilation errors that arise from the version changes.
5.  **Verify Functionality:** We will work together to ensure that the application is running and functioning as expected in its original, stable state.

**Deliverable:** A stable, working application on an older, compatible version of Angular and Ionic.

## Phase 3: Incremental Upgrade

**Goal:** To safely upgrade the application to the latest versions of Angular and Ionic, one major version at a time.

**Steps (to be repeated for each major version upgrade):**

1.  **Run Update Commands:** I will provide you with the exact `ng update` commands to run for Angular and Ionic.
2.  **Analyze and Fix Breaking Changes:** I will analyze the code and fix any breaking changes that are introduced by the upgrade.
3.  **Verify and Commit:** We will verify that the application is still working as expected, and then I will ask you to commit the changes.

**Deliverable:** A fully migrated, stable, and modern application running on the latest versions of Angular and Ionic.
