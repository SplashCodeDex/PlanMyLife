# Release Manuscript

## Project: DeXdo-Plan_Your_Life

**Date:** 2025-09-04

### Overview

This document outlines the significant changes and architectural decisions made during the recent development cycle. The primary goal was to modernize the project by migrating from a traditional Angular module-based architecture to a more streamlined standalone component architecture.

### Architectural Changes

The application has been refactored to use Angular's standalone components, directives, and pipes. This change was made to simplify the codebase, improve performance, and align with modern Angular best practices.

The key changes include:

*   **Standalone Components:** The application now bootstraps a standalone `AppComponent`. The old `AppModule` and other feature modules are no longer used for compilation but have been left in the codebase for reference during the transition.
*   **Provider Configuration:** All providers have been moved from the old `NgModule` `providers` arrays to the `providers` array in `app.config.ts` and `main.ts`. This centralizes the application's configuration.
*   **Routing:** The application now uses the new `provideRouter` function in `app.config.ts` instead of the `RouterModule`.

### Bug Fixes and Dependency Updates

Several issues were resolved during this development cycle:

*   **Swiper Integration:** The Swiper.js integration was updated to work with the latest version of the library. This involved removing the old `SwiperModule` and using Swiper's web components directly, which required adding `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` to the relevant component schemas and registering the Swiper elements in `main.ts`.
*   **Mapbox GL Dependency:** A CommonJS dependency warning for `mapbox-gl` was resolved by adding it to the `allowedCommonJsDependencies` in `angular.json`.
*   **Dependency Injection Errors:** A `NullInjectorError` that was causing a blank screen on application startup was resolved by providing the necessary services (such as `FormsModule`, `ReactiveFormsModule`, and `IonicRouteStrategy`) in the `app.config.ts` file.

### Current Status

The application now successfully compiles and runs with the new standalone architecture. The previous compilation and runtime errors have been resolved.

There are some remaining warnings related to unused files from the old module-based architecture. These can be addressed in a future development cycle by updating the `tsconfig.app.json` to be more specific about which files to include in the compilation.

### Future Work

The `ToDo.md` file contains a list of suggested future enhancements and improvements for the project.
